The first step in our workflow is creating the `uniform types` that will serve as the building blocks for our api. These will serve two purposes: GraphQL schema generation, and compile time type safety for our resolvers. Let's begin with the built-in scalars.

`uniform-graphql` ships with 5 built-in scalars:

|             | TypeScript         | GraphQL    |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ---------- |
| `t.string`  | `string`           | `String!`  |
| `t.float`   | `number`           | `Float!`   |
| `t.int`     | `number`           | `Int!`     |
| `t.id`      | `string \| number` | `ID!`      |
| `t.boolean` | `boolean`          | `Boolean!` |
