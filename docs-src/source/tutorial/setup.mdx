## Dependencies

We have `graphql` as a peer dependency, and we recommend installing `tslib` for optimizing bundle sizes and performance. You'll need `TypeScript` to run our library. We also recommend installing `ts-node-dev` to have a more seamless developer experience.

```bash
# Instaling our library and two runtime dependencies:
npm install @whatsgood/uniform-graphql graphql tslib

# Installing our dev-dependencies:
npm install --save-dev ts-node-dev typescript
```

## Recommended TSConfig

`Uniform-GraphQL` is built with strong type-safety in mind, and assumes that you are fully taking advantage of `TypeScript`'s type system. With that in mind, here's our recommended `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2018",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "lib": ["es2018", "esnext.asynciterable"],
    "alwaysStrict": true,
    "strict": true,
    "preserveConstEnums": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "importHelpers": true,
    "noImplicitReturns": true,
    "noImplicitThis": true
  }
}
```

## GraphQL Server

In this tutorial, you will be building a schema through `Uniform GraphQL`, which you will serve through a `GraphQL` server of your choosing. We recommend `Apollo Server`.

```bash
# Installing Apollo Server and its peer dependency: express
npm install apollo-server-express express
```

## Running Your Server

If you've installed `ts-node-dev`, you will be able to run your server in watch mode, which will keep seemlessly restarting the server process whenever it detects a file change. We recommend adding `ts-node-dev` script to your `package.json`. When you're done, you should have a `package.json` that roughly looks like this:

```json
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "ts-node-dev --respawn ./src/index.ts"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@whatsgood/uniform-graphql": "0.2.5",
    "apollo-server-express": "2.19.0",
    "express": "4.17.1",
    "tslib": "2.1.0",
    "graphql": "15.5.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "4.2.3",
    "ts-node-dev": "1.1.6"
  }
}
```
