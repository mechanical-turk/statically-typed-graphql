## Dependencies

We have `graphql` as a peer dependency, and we recommend installing `tslib` for optimizing bundle sizes and performance. You'll need `TypeScript` to run our library. We also recommend installing `ts-node` to have a more seamless developer experience.

```bash
# Instaling our library and two runtime dependencies:
npm install @whatsgood/uniform-graphql graphql tslib

# Installing our dev-dependencies:
npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
```

## Recommended TSConfig

`Uniform-GraphQL` is built with strong type-safety in mind, and assumes that you are fully taking advantage of `TypeScript`'s type system. With that in mind, here's our recommended `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2018",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "lib": ["es2018", "esnext.asynciterable"],
    "alwaysStrict": true,
    "strict": true,
    "preserveConstEnums": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "importHelpers": true,
    "noImplicitReturns": true,
    "noImplicitThis": true
  }
}
```
