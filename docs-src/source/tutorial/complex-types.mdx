description: Combine simple types into complex types

The real value of `Uniform GraphQL` comes from how it lets you mix and match simpler types into more complex types. The fundamental complex types are `Objects`, and `Lists`. Let's see how we can create and utilize them.

## Object

`Objects` are arguably the most important element of any type system, because they let you combine different types into a structured format that can represent complex concepts.

```ts:title=src/index.ts
//...

const Animal = t.object({
  name: 'Animal',
  fields: {
    name: t.string,
    age: t.int,
    isDomesticated: t.boolean,
  },
});

schemaBuilder.query('myFavoritePet', {
  type: Animal,
  resolve: () => {
    return {
      age: 4,
      isDomesticated: true,
      name: 'Lulu',
    };
  },
});

//...
```

In the example above, we combined 3 [scalars](/types/scalars) into one [object](/types/objects) type in a structured manner. However, we can keep building more complex [objects](/types/objects) that have [enums](/types/enums) and other [objects](/types/objects) as their fields.

```ts{9,10,15,21}:title=src/index.ts
//...

const User = t.object({
  name: 'User',
  fields: {
    id: t.id,
    email: t.string,
    fullName: t.string,
    age: t.int.nullable,
    pet: Animal.nullable,
  },
});

schemaBuilder.query('currentUser', {
  type: User.nullable,
  resolve: () => {
    return {
      id: '1',
      email: 'email@email.com',
      fullName: 'John Johnson',
      // age
      pet: {
        age: 4,
        isDomesticated: true,
        name: 'Lulu',
      },
    };
  },
});

//...
```

Pay attention to the highlighted lines. You can see that the `.nullable` modifier is at work once again. Since the `age` field is nullable, we are allowed to skip it in our resolver even if it's embedded inside an object field. Note that the resolve type is also `User.nullable`. Simple or complex, we can always keep using the `nullable` modifier in any type we create.

## Lists

Lists are another way of creating complex types from simpler ones. In the example below, we're creating a resolver that returns a list of users. Notice how the list type is constructed, and how the resolver now has to return an array.

```ts{4,6,17}:title=src/index.ts
//...

schemaBuilder.query('activeUsers', {
  type: t.list(User),
  resolve: () => {
    return [
      {
        id: '2',
        email: 'bob@bob.com',
        fullName: 'Bob Bobson',
      },
      {
        id: '3',
        email: 'tim@tim.com',
        fullName: 'Tim Timson',
      },
    ];
  },
});

//...
```

## Checkpoint

If you've been following along, your `GraphQL` schema should roughly look like the snippet bellow. Pay attention to the highlighted line. Since we didn't denote either the list or the object as `.nullable`, the final type is `[User!]!`.

```graphql{35}
enum Membership {
  free
  paid
  enterprise
}

type Animal {
  name: String!
  age: Int!
  isDomesticated: Boolean!
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  email: String!
  fullName: String!
  age: Int
  pet: Animal
}

type Query {
  hello: String!
  favoriteInteger: Int!
  favoriteFloat: Float!
  isLearning: Boolean!
  idExample: ID!
  anotherIdExample: ID!
  stringExample: String
  voidExample: String
  nullExample: String
  undefinedExample: String
  myMembership: Membership!
  myFavoritePet: Animal!
  currentUser: User
  activeUsers: [User!]!
}
```
