Primitive types are the simplest building blocks of `GraphQL`. They depend on nothing else, but everything else depends on them. These are [scalars](../types/scalars) and [enums](../types/enums). You might have noticed that we are using this `t.string` value to communicate the resolve type of our `hello` query. That's just one of the many types you can use in `Uniform GraphQL`. Before we dive into the primitives, let's take a step back and see how types are even used in `Uniform GraphQL`:

## Type Safety

```ts
//...

// This resolver has an error on purpose.
schemaBuilder.query('favoriteInteger', {
  type: t.int,
  resolve: () => {
    // Returning a String even though the resolve type is Int
    return '999';
  },
});

// ...
```

This resolver has an **error** on purpose. What do you see when you copy these lines to your `index.ts`?
What you've just witnessed is the simplest example of how `Uniform GraphQL` helps you with type safety:

## Nullability

Below are a few example of valid resolver functions for a nullable string. Pay attention to the `.nullable` modifier on `t.string.nullable`. You will keep using this to turn your types into their nullable counterparts.

```ts{4,11,16,23}
//...

schemaBuilder.query('stringExample', {
  type: t.string.nullable,
  resolve: () => {
    return 'string value';
  },
});

schemaBuilder.query('voidExample', {
  type: t.string.nullable,
  resolve: () => {},
});

schemaBuilder.query('nullExample', {
  type: t.string.nullable,
  resolve: () => {
    return null;
  },
});

schemaBuilder.query('undefinedExample', {
  type: t.string.nullable,
  resolve: () => {
    return undefined;
  },
});

//
```

## Built-in Scalars

Built-in [scalars](../types/scalars) are the simplest types that you can use. You can use them out of the box in `Uniform GraphQL`. Copy the lines below into your `index.ts` and navigate to your playground to observe how your `GraphQL` schema changes. **Don't forget to refresh your browser!**

```ts:title=src/index.ts
//...

schemaBuilder.query('favoriteInteger', {
  type: t.int,
  resolve: () => 999,
});

schemaBuilder.query('favoriteFloat', {
  type: t.float,
  resolve: () => 999.999,
});

schemaBuilder.query('isLearning', {
  type: t.boolean,
  resolve: () => true,
});

/**
 * GraphQL spec allows both string and
 * number values for the ID typedef.
 */

schemaBuilder.query('idExample', {
  type: t.id,
  resolve: () => 'string id',
});

schemaBuilder.query('anotherIdExample', {
  type: t.id,
  resolve: () => 15,
});

//...
```

## Enums

The second primitive type in `GraphQL` is [enums](../types/enums). Use these to denote a set of predetermined string literals for your resolvers. Pay attention to the highlighted line. You will need to use the `as const` modifier when resolving enums. Otherwise, values get interpreted as regular strings instead of specific string literals.

```ts{15}:title=src/index.ts
//...

const Membership = t.enum({
  name: 'Membership',
  values: {
    free: null,
    paid: null,
    enterprise: null,
  },
});

schemaBuilder.query('myMembership', {
  type: Membership,
  resolve: () => {
    return 'free' as const;
  },
});

//...
```

## Checkpoint

Once you're done adding all these new resolvers, navigate back to your `GraphQL Playground` and verify that your schema matches the typedefs below. Try changing the returned values from the resolvers and query your API to observe the changes.

```graphql
enum Membership {
  free
  paid
  enterprise
}

type Query {
  hello: String!
  favoriteInteger: Int!
  favoriteFloat: Float!
  isLearning: Boolean!
  idExample: ID!
  anotherIdExample: ID!
  stringExample: String
  voidExample: String
  nullExample: String
  undefinedExample: String
  myMembership: Membership!
}
```
