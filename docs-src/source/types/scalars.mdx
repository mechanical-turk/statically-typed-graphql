## Built-In Scalars

The first step in our workflow is creating the `uniform types` that will serve as the building blocks for our api. These will serve two purposes: `GraphQL` schema generation, and compile time type safety for our resolvers. Let's begin with the built-in scalars. `Uniform GraphQL` ships with 5 built-in scalars:

| Uniform GraphQL | TypeScript         | GraphQL    |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ---------- |
| `t.string`      | `string`           | `String!`  |
| `t.float`       | `number`           | `Float!`   |
| `t.int`         | `number`           | `Int!`     |
| `t.id`          | `string \| number` | `ID!`      |
| `t.boolean`     | `boolean`          | `Boolean!` |

## Custom Scalars

<!-- TODO: nail the custom scalars -->

Use the `t.scalar` type factory to create custom scalars, which will carry both runtime and compile time type information just like any other type in our system.
